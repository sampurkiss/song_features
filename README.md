# song_features
Database and programs to analyze a set of song features

Databases:
Hot Stuff.csv has weekly billboard top 100 charts
song_details.csv has feature details pulled from the Spotify api for all weekly Billboard top 100 hits from 1997 onward.
The feature details were gathered using song and artist names from the Hot Stuff database and running them through the get_music_features function from charts_analyzer.py.
